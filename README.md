RoboCodeGit
===========

A box for all my robocode projects.

The newest and most continuously updated project is the cwru package.
  This is still in the development and testing phase of data structure.
  - My long term goal for it is to have a stable base from which to expand future projects, regardless of aim.
  - The short term goal is to stabilize the storage, and make sure all computational classes access it properly.
  
  The next steps for the project include updating the projection machinery up through accelerometer projection 
    and circular projection.
  The goal is to have a series of projections made, and then choose which projection maintains accuracy by comparing
    each projection every time.
  A list of more in depth projections that will run in parallel or independently
  1. Pattern matching
  2. Pattern analysis (statistical analysis)
  3. Guess and Check AI (Takes in data, makes a guess, learns from guess, repeat)
  
  Movement is another area of development. It it currently a random walk program that I have yet to observe properly.
  I predict that it will have some success, but it is just a place holder while I test other parts of the robot.
  A list of more in depth movement ideas:
  0. Random walk
  0.5 Gravity movement (optional)
  1. Wave surfing
  2. research, find some interesting math, see if it works. 
      This is probably the lowest on my priority if I get a solid wave surf working.
