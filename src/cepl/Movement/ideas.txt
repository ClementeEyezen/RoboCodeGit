The movement code will have a number of options, including:

Wave Surfing (avoid places where current bullets might be)
Flat-Movement on fire (1v1, as % of escape velocity): go to a different fraction 
    of the escape angle
Hot-Bullets Wave Surfing: avoid head on, linear, accelerator shots and/or common hit points

State Space forward projection: calculate all possible steps, and take the least dangerous path

//TODO
- Wave Surfing
- Flat Movement
- Hot-Bullets
- State-Search

Important common classes :
MoveScript - a series of point to point moves that tell the robot exactly what to do for the 
  extent of the script. (Given as delta headings and speed settings.)
ScriptGenerator - takes a series of waypoints and then generates the MoveScript between the two.
  [options for smooth curve or point to point]
  //the idea is that each generation method can return a list of points to travel through,
  //  and the script generator will turn that into specific instructions

//TODO
et.al.
